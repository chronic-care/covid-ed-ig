  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide describes Clinical Decsion Support (CDS) for the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)
    Emergency Department COVID-19 Severity Classification guideline. This logic represents an initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
    that implements a subset of the logic defined by ACEP. Refer to the <a href="https://www.acep.org/globalassets/sites/acep/media/covid-19-main/acep_evidencecare_covid19severitytool.pdf">ACEP Guideline</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This MVP implementation is intended to align with, and eventually be replaced by, an equivalent logic library with substantially
    expanded functionality that is generated from OMG Business Process Modeling (BPM+) decision and case models, using an
    automated toolchain. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/OpenCPG">Open Clinical Practice Guidelines</a> GitHub project.

    The main sections of this IG are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="background.html">Background</a> - provides business context for the implementation guide and information that implementers should be
      familiar with before reading the remainder of the IG.  There could be multiple pages for this.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="spec.html">Detailed Specification</a> - The actual stuff implementers are expected to do.  (Could be multiple pages for this.)
